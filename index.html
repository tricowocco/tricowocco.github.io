          <p>The 2017 Womxn of Color Conference at Haverford College recognizes that the experiences of a womyn/womxn/women of color are distinct from others’. As members of distinctly marginalized communities, our experiences and identities intersect within many forms of oppression. Such intersections shape how we interact and move through specific spaces and communities. With much excitement, we welcome everyone who identify as womyn/womxn/women of color within the Tri-college consortium to join us on February 25, 2017 to reflect, learn, and lead together.</p>
          <div class="about_footnote">
            <p>While our commission is made up of different people who each use their own spelling of womyn/womxn/women, the spelling of "womyn" is used on this page as the rejection of womynhood being defined in relation to manhood and the patriarchal norm. We would also like to recognize the use of "womxn" to honor many unspoken hxstories and particularly the erased and silenced hxstories of the land we are on. We welcome everyone and your definition of womyn/womxn/women to participate in this conference.</p>

          <p>The 2017 Womxn of Color Conference at Haverford College recognizes that the experiences of a womyn/womxn/women of color are distinct from others’. As members of distinctly marginalized communities, our experiences and identities may be characterized and constrained by many forms of oppression that are built into  some of the  systems, spaces and communities we must navigate throughout our lives. This conference seeks to foster empowerment for undergraduates who identify as womyn/womxn/women of color within the Tri-college consortium through strengthening a shared sense of community among this often underrepresented group. Through a combination of individual reflection and the sharing of collective knowledge, we seek to create an enriching and safe space for womyn/womxn/women of color. Moreover, we hope to foster the development of womyn/womxn/women of color as leaders in the classroom, on/off campus, and in their surrounding communities through a diverse range of panel topics. We envision a transformative experience where womyn/womxn/women of color from diverse backgrounds can come together to engage in meaningful dialogue, cultivate greater social consciousness, and foster solidarity amongst one another.</p>

          <p>Keynote Speaker: Paula Brathwaite<br />
          Moderator: Asali Solomon<br />
          Panelists: Reema Keswani, Marla Dominguez, Nathalia Trujillo, Candace Jordan</p>
          <p>As a scholar, Candace believes in the power of retrieving everyday voices alongside scholarly conversations, and as an activist, she believes in the limitless possibility of change. The combination of these two frameworks for understanding herself, her local communities, and the world has shaped the research projects, civic engagement, and professional work that she’s undertaken across three continents. In her volunteer roles, Candace has enjoyed building English language fluency with Indian and Somali immigrants. In her teaching and tutoring at New York University Abu Dhabi and Haverford College, Candace encourages students to allow their intersectional identities to be lenses through which to pursue rigorous inquiry and practice deep self-care. Her favorite ways to restore include long naps, domestic and international travel, and knitting.</p>
